# stackmate deploy

The `stackmate deploy` command deploys the services that are assigned to a stage

### Usage

```
stackmate deploy <stage>
```

### Arguments

* `<stage>` should be one of the stages declared inside your `.stackmate/config.yml` file, for example `production` or `staging`.

### Options

* `--input <directory>` - If specified, stackmate will look into said directory for the output files that are generated by a previous [`stackmate synth`](stackmate-synth.md) run. If not, stackmate will attempt to synthesize the project for you.
* `--output <directory>` - Specifies the directory to write the output files to. By default, exports into the project's stackmate directory (eg. `.stackmate`).
