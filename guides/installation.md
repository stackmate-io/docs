# Installation

Installing stackmate is a simple, straight forward process where all you need is an `npm` client such as `npm` itself or `yarn`

### Installation as a global package through NPM

You can install stackmate through NPM by using the following command:

```
npm install -g @stackmate/cli
```

### Installation as a global package through Yarn

Same for yarn:

```
yarn global add @stackmate/cli
```

### Direct usage through NPX

We recommend that you install stackmate globally, however if you don't want to or if you just wanna give it a quick spin, feel free to run the package directly through `npx` using the following command:

```
npx @stckmate/cli [init / deploy/ ...] [...options]
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Throughout the course of this documentation, we will assume that the package is globally available in the system and we'll be using `stackmate` as our executable
{% endhint %}
