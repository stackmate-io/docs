# Output files

Stackmate generates configuration files when running any of its commands. Let's break them down and see what can be committed to source control and what not.

The default location would be right next to your configuration file, but you can specify a different directory when running the commands, for example:

```
npx @stackmate/stackmate -c myconfig.yml -d stackmate/
```

Assuming that you are deploying a simple web application, you can use `.stackmate` as a configuration directory that holds your `config.yml` configuration file and the generated stacks.

```
my-project
│   ...
├── .stackmate
│   └── config.yml
├── ...
└── index.html
```

### What files are generated by stackmate

When running any stackmate command, the following files get generated:

* **Project stacks** - Stackmate generates a set of JSON files, which are then used by Terraform to deploy your stacks. These are generated by CDKTF and further documentation can be found on [CDKTF's documentation](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/cdktf#how-it-works) page.
* **Terraform internal files** - When using stackmate, we run Terraform for you, which creates a set files used internally.

An example structure of the files created, is illustrated below:

```bash
my-project
│   ...
├── .stackmate
│   │   stacks/
│   │   └── production
│   │        ├── .terraform
│   │        │     ├── providers
│   │        │     └── terraform.tfstate
│   │        ├── .terraform.lock.hcl
│   │        ├── main.tf.json
│   │        └── plan # optionally, if you run stackmate preview
│   │         
│   └── config.yml
├── ...
└── index.html
```

### Should I commit the files that are generated by Stackmate?

**You don't have to, but if you do, please have a quick look first**: We designed stackmate in such a way that every auto-generated file does not contain any sensitive information but also, we don't need any local files to be stored in the repository for stackmate to run. To avoid mistakes, please append this section to your `.gitignore`:\


```gitignore
# file: .gitignore
stacks/**/plan
stacks/**/.terraform
terraform.tfstate

# Optionally, you can ignore the dependency lock file, but as per the Terraform
# documentation, you can commit it in version control to lock the provider versions:
# https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/files/dependency-lock
#
# .terraform.lock.hcl
```

### Where does stackmate keep my secrets?

Stackmate doesn't know anything about your secrets. They're generated when you deploy a stage as random values and they're safely stored in your provider's credentials service (for example AWS secrets store)
